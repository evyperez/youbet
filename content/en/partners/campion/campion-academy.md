## About Campion Academy

Founded in 1907, [Campion Academy](https://campion.net) is a Seventh-day Adventist Christian boarding school in Loveland, Colorado, that empowers students to grow in faith, expand their minds, and serve the world. Campion Academy promotes excellence in Christian education with the purpose of providing an academic program that prepares students to excel in college or technical school and become productive citizens.

## Activities

Recognizing the varied abilities and goals of its students, Campion Academy offers three diploma paths: general high school diploma, college preparatory diploma, and advanced college preparatory diploma. As students plan their program, they are encouraged to be realistic about their abilities, background, interests, and future plans. Students work with teachers, counselors, and parents as they shape their path. Campion Academy offers excellence in academics, music, sports, arts, an English language program, a variety of electives, and plenty of outdoor activities in the Rocky Mountains—including STEM and extracurricular clubs.

## ESL Program

Campion Academy offers an English as a Second Language (ESL) program for students who are not yet proficient in English. Instruction is tailored to each student’s level and is designed to help them reach their proficiency goals. Students meet daily with instructors to improve reading, writing, listening, and speaking. They continue until they reach level three on the International Test of English Proficiency (iTEP SLATE). Each student also participates in study skills and academic support at the Learning Resource Center. High-achieving Campion students serve as International Ambassadors, working with international students in tutoring and cultural exchange.
