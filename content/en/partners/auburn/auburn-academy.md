## Activities

Auburn Adventist Academy offers classes in graphic design, audiovisual, music, swimming with a focus on lifeguarding, culinary arts, and sports, with students competing in regional championships. Chemistry, biology, and technology labs are part of daily student life. Music studio, piano, guitar, and voice lessons, and the internationally known Bel Canto choir are central to campus life. Flight training and a private airstrip are another highlight—students can take flying lessons during high school and become licensed pilots.
