## Winter Experience

The winter exchange is a short-term program to learn a new language with international certification and cultural immersion. It includes classes, talks, and cultural outings, and the chance to experience northern winter and winter-only activities.

You also join the ESL – English as a Second Language – program to improve reading, writing, listening, and speaking, with individualized instruction to reach your English goals. All classes are taught by American teachers, deepening your knowledge and culture.
